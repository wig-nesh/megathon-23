- Thanks to [Disha](https://github.com/dishap22), [Ami](https://github.com/AmiBuch), [Harshith](https://github.com/harshithseera) and [Neha](https://github.com/Nmuser818) for working on this with me.
- This is a very barebones proof of concept implementation of an application to make the lives of job recruiters and applications easier.
